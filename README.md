# Hello MMC3

This is a minimal boilerplate project for making NES roms using the
[MMC3](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC3) mapper

This is for my personal use, and may not be exactly what you are looking for,
but feel free to make use of it if you want!

## Special Thanks

[nesdoug](https://github.com/nesdoug) for some of the MMC3 stuff

[Michael Chiaramonte](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIp73jJFLgicEywj1e7e-1A)
for parts of the initialization routine :)
