# MMC3 Template

This is a minimal boilerplate project for making NES roms using the
[MMC3](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC3) mapper with CA65

This is mostly for my personal use, and may not be exactly what you are looking for,
but feel free to make use of it if you want!

## Compilation

Make sure that you have `ca65` installed!

simply run `make` in the project directory and it should compile and output everything to the `/out` directory

## Special Thanks

[nesdoug](https://github.com/nesdoug) for some of the MMC3 configuration stuff
